# Implementation Architecture

UltraPlan is module-driven. Product modules own their state and workflows;
local interfaces adapt shared typed application use cases.

## Local Interface Composition

The process entry point explicitly constructs the independent TUI and web
runners:

```text
cmd/ultraplan -> internal/app
cmd/ultraplan -> internal/tui
cmd/ultraplan -> internal/web

internal/tui -> internal/app
internal/web -> internal/app
internal/app -> product and platform modules
```

This composition avoids the prohibited `internal/app -> internal/web ->
internal/app` cycle. Runners are ordinary injected functions; there is no
package-global mutable registry, `init` callback, service locator, or
context-carried dependency. Web templates, HTTP state, and the listener are
initialized only after the `serve` command has completed workspace/config and
listen-policy preflight. Help, version, other CLI commands, and TUI startup do
not initialize web facilities.

## Web Adapter Boundary

`internal/app/web_usecases.go` owns the browser query facade, while the closed
operation capability in `internal/app/operations.go` is shared with the TUI. It
provides typed dashboard, project, sprint, study, validation, artifact, and
health projections plus allowlisted operation normalization, affected paths,
mutation class, prerequisites, governed-input inventory, SHA-256 fingerprint,
safe progress/result projections, and canonical context cancellation.

`internal/web` receives only that interface and its plain app result types. It
owns:

- loopback `net/http` lifecycle and graceful shutdown
- HTML and `/api/v1` routing
- transport DTOs and safe error envelopes
- Host/Origin, request-limit, concurrency, and security-header middleware
- per-process session/CSRF and short-lived binding confirmation policy
- the bounded ephemeral operation hub, retained safe event/result projections,
  progress-only SSE, and subscriber lifecycle
- `html/template` view models and embedded first-party assets
- escaped source presentation and redacted request/lifecycle diagnostics

It does not import project, sprint, study, workspace, runtime, process, or CLI
handler packages. It cannot decide workflow semantics, persist product state,
invoke providers or the smoke harness directly, run Git, or read arbitrary
files. It starts only the typed app operation capability supplied by the
composition root.

## State And Artifact Ownership

Workspace files and product-owned flow, execute, review, smoke, and study run
state remain authoritative. Web requests perform fresh sequential app queries.
The server retains only immutable configuration, parsed embedded templates,
listener/server objects, request/session IDs, opaque artifact references,
short-lived confirmations, and bounded ephemeral operation/event/subscriber
state. The hub is transport lifecycle state, not workflow authority: it holds
at most eight active owners, recent already-redacted events, cancellation
handles, and terminal projections for ten minutes. It never persists a queue
or operation history.

Read-only sprint status uses the sprint service's non-persisting projection
mode. Product-owned workspace artifacts, execute/review/smoke state, study run
state, and per-sprint/study mutation locks remain authoritative. Restart and
replay-gap recovery direct users back to that durable state rather than
reconstructing product truth from the hub. Server startup acquires product
leases conservatively and reconciles only dead-owner sprint attempts; live
cross-process work is not rewritten.

Opaque artifact references are issued by the app boundary. Resolution repeats
the allowlist check, lexical containment, and symlink-aware canonical
containment before a bounded file read. `internal/web/artifacts.go` validates
the returned media/size contract and renders the source; it has no filesystem
capability.

## Single-Binary Frontend

Go embeds the namespaced template hierarchy and all layered CSS/JavaScript under
`internal/web`. Templates parse once when serving starts; validation rejects
missing definitions, duplicates, cycles, unnamespaced references, and upward or
same-layer dependencies before a request can be accepted. Pages render to a
buffer before response headers. Contextual `html/template` escaping, app-owned
safe Markdown rendering, escaped JSON/fallback source, CSP, and `nosniff` keep
hostile workspace content inert.

Definitions compose downward through `page/* -> layout/* -> component/* ->
primitive/*`. CSS exposes tokens, base, primitives, components, layouts, and
utilities layers. Dependency-free JavaScript separates baseline page lifetime,
HTTP operation commands, and SSE ownership while preserving the compatibility
bundle used by the Sprint 31 browser.

Initial HTML is complete without JavaScript and uses semantic headings,
navigation, breadcrumbs, landmarks, tables/definition lists, status text,
visible focus, narrow single-column reflow, local code/table overflow, zoom
support, and reduced-motion behavior. No Node.js, Vite, framework, hydration,
client router/store, third-party assets, separate frontend process, or asset
build step exists.

## Operation Ownership And Shutdown

Preparation is side-effect-free and does not reserve capacity or acquire a
mutation lock. Start repeats normalization and fingerprinting, consumes one
session-bound confirmation, and creates a server-owned context immediately;
there is no web queue. Sprint flow, execute, review, smoke, and verify use one
product-owned per-sprint cross-process mutation lease. Study run-loop keeps its
independent product lock.

Each accepted operation has one canonical cancel function and terminal
arbitration point. Slow or disconnected SSE subscribers cannot block or cancel
product work. Graceful shutdown enters draining, rejects new work, requests
`server_shutdown` cancellation once per owner, waits outside hub/product locks
for bounded cleanup and durable reconciliation, publishes a truthful terminal
event, closes subscribers, and only then shuts down HTTP. If the deadline
expires, the app boundary atomically persists a product-owned sprint recovery
marker before transport closure. That marker is separate from canonical run
state so the web layer never races a live lease holder; startup consumes it
only after canonical state is reconciled under the normal product lease. No
detached operation is intentionally allowed to outlive the server.

Smoke authoring uses before/after target identities for diagnosis and retained
runtime tool events for write attribution. Concurrent target drift without an
observed protected-path write is recorded but does not fail a local smoke run;
an author-attributed protected write and any out-of-allowlist harness mutation
remain hard failures. Attribution observes the live runtime event callback and
does not depend on the bounded retained-event tail.

## QA verification phase

`VerificationPhase` is independent from `PlanningStage`. It names `conformance-review`, `qa`, and the reserved future `repair` phase without inserting QA into planning order or changing `StageReview`, `StageSmoke`, `review.md`, or `smoke.md`. Human interfaces say Conformance Review; the `review` machine identity remains authoritative.

Four authorities remain separate:

- governed project and sprint artifacts plus implementation content are product inputs;
- `internal/sprint` owns deterministic QA maps, shards, theories, synthesis, and detailed filesystem state;
- `internal/runcontrol` owns operational acceptance, leases, fencing, cancellation, events, and terminal arbitration;
- `internal/app` owns typed projections and operation preparation consumed by CLI, TUI, and web.

The detailed state root is `projects/<project>/sprints/<sprint>/verification/`. `state.json` is the current pointer. Sprint 36 read-only map, shard, and synthesis records remain readable as strict schema v1. Evidence-producing Sprint 37 attempts write strict schema v2 plans, evidence, adjudication, issues, assessment, and report pointers. Both versions are private, path-contained, digest-checked, and atomically written. Publication writes referenced records first, then `state.json`, then the bounded `flow-state.json` summary. The flow summary never stores theories or attempt history. Recovery may reconcile a validated terminal pointer and summary but never fabricates runtime completion.

Mapping normalizes governed input traces, current execute changed paths, current Conformance Review evidence, target/Git identity, boundaries, risks, the approved-check catalog, effective policy, and every numeric limit. IDs use the local `qa-v1` namespace and are deterministic only within this schema and sprint scope. Every changed path has exactly one primary owner; boundary overlap is explicit and bounded.

Runtime QA starts only after durable acceptance and owner claim. The app converts the accepted run fence into an opaque sprint writer token, and every product-state publication revalidates it. Investigators run with `read_only`, restricted permissions, required permission capability, default deny, and path rules limited to assigned changed/context files. They cannot choose commands. Approved checks use a closed descriptor catalog with explicit executable, argv, cwd, environment-name allowlist, timeout, output limit, and fingerprint; shell wrappers, Git, interpreters, redirection, and write modes are rejected.

Each attempt compares the full implementation/Git identity immediately before and after runtime work, records contained symlink identity, and rebuilds the deterministic map before promotion to detect governed-input, review, policy, catalog, or target drift. Fixed workers and bounded queues enforce concurrency; cancellation stops admission and preserves already validated terminal shards. Resume reuses only current completed or blocked product records with a new durable owner. It never adopts processes, goroutines, or provider sessions.

Final synthesis is pure over validated current shards. It retains all outcome classes, deduplicates equivalent theories, preserves contradictions and cross-shard interactions, and proposes at most the configured parent-linked follow-ups. `completed` means the bounded investigation ended. Synthesis has no issue, repair, patch, generated-check, `qa.md`, or Conformance Review verdict authority.

The dependency direction remains `internal/web` → `internal/app` → `internal/sprint`; web does not import sprint, inspect verification files, build prompts, invoke runtimes, or decide outcomes.

## Deferred Phase 4 Capabilities

Hosted or LAN/public serving, accounts, authentication, TLS, teams, tenants,
collaboration, remote workers, browser editing, WebSockets, terminal transport,
general-purpose issue tracking, automatic fixes, database state, and general
Git automation remain outside the local web architecture. The shared app
composition may inject configured stage publication into product services.

## Grounded Planning And Shared Prompt Boundary

`internal/sprint` owns `code-context` generation, validation, source-reference resolution, and downstream prompt composition. The complete common prefix is rendered once per top-level operation in this fixed order: stable shared instructions; project/sprint identity; an external frame containing the exact stored `requirements.md` bytes; an external frame containing the exact stored reference-only `code-context.md` bytes; transient resolved source evidence in authored order; and one constant stage-specific boundary as the final prefix bytes. Stage names, output paths/contracts, task and reviewer identities, model/run/session/attempt data, timestamps, and smoke scope occur only after that boundary or in runtime metadata.

Reference resolution is repository-contained, symlink-rejecting, regular-file-only, cancellation-aware, and fail-closed. References retain their authored labels, rationale, and symbol metadata while selected ranges from the same file are sorted and merged so source bytes are injected once and each file is scanned once. The complete shared prefix is capped at 256 KiB; overflow is an actionable error, never truncation or omission. Stage suffixes include every available governed input in full and defer context-window enforcement to the selected runtime model and provider. Evidence is marked untrusted, and agents retain permission to inspect additional live source.

The first non-dry-run code-context operation creates a sprint-owned linked Git worktree from the configured target's current `HEAD`. UltraPlan records the source root, baseline commit, branch, worktree path, and creation time in the sprint's `.workspace.json`. The source checkout must be clean. The worktree remains writable during execution, but its assignment never changes implicitly. Later code-context, planning, execute, review, and smoke operations reuse it. A missing or invalid recorded worktree fails closed once the record exists. Existing sprints without a record retain direct-target compatibility until code-context runs again.

## Git stage publication

`internal/platform/gitpublish` owns the Git subprocess boundary for configured post-stage commit and push. Product services decide when a stage has valid canonical output and supply an exact set of owned paths. The publisher resolves the repository and current branch, serializes work by Git common directory, builds the commit from a temporary index, updates the branch only when its parent is unchanged, and reconciles only the published paths in the real index. Unrelated staged and unstaged changes remain untouched.

Study run-loop serializes only terminal state, history, and publication; runtime workers stay parallel. Sprint planning publishes workspace artifacts. Execute publishes the dedicated implementation worktree before its workspace evidence. Smoke may publish manifest-allowlisted harness authoring paths before its workspace summary and roadmap change. Raw smoke evidence remains external. Agents cannot invoke Git mutation, and transport adapters cannot choose publication paths.

Push failures do not rewrite product completion state. They return an operation error while leaving the local commit available for a no-duplicate retry. Publication never runs for dry runs, invalid artifacts, runtime failures, or cancellations.

After code-context validation, UltraPlan may persist a bounded, content-addressed, disposable context pack under `.ultra/cache/sprint-context/`; existing sprints create one lazily on their first runtime composition while prompt previews stay read-only. Its identity is derived only from the exact requirements, exact code-context artifact, and canonical sprint target; it freezes the resolved source bytes so execution edits do not churn the planning prefix. It is an acceleration layer, never provenance or freshness authority: write failure is non-fatal, missing or invalid packs fall back to live resolution, and artifact changes select a different identity without invalidating, rerunning, or reopening completed stages. Exact-match dependency freshness remains disabled.

`internal/platform/runtime` receives the final ordinary prompt plus content-free cache metadata: the stable-prefix digest, byte breakpoint, and a provider/model/work-directory cohort key. The current agentwrap/OpenCode boundary transports these values as metadata only; it cannot yet place a native cache-control breakpoint inside the single provider message, so no cache hit is guaranteed. Planning, execute, independent review requests, and agent-backed smoke authoring call the sprint-owned composition boundary explicitly. Review fan-out shares one immutable prefix. Runtime results append bounded, content-free prompt, token, cache-read/cache-write, cost, and timing measurements to the sprint's `.runtime-metrics.json`; `sprint ... metrics` exposes them. Prepared handoff packets and per-stage input contracts minimize downstream artifact reads without becoming dependency fingerprints; when present, the technical handbook's `Examples Worth Investigating` (or legacy `Examples Worth Inspecting`) section is copied directly into plan and execute prompts.

Execute owns one reusable runtime session for the ordered pending-task queue rather than one independent agent per task. Its initial turn carries the shared sprint prefix, queue primer, current task, safety instructions, and optional handbook examples. After each task UltraPlan persists task-specific evidence and status, then submits only the next task delta with `SessionAction=continue`. A missing runtime session ID degrades safely to another complete prompt; failure or cancellation stops queue advancement, while explicit deferral may advance to the next task. Cross-command session reuse is based on model and target compatibility, not exact artifact fingerprints.

## Durable run control

UltraPlan records runtime-backed and asynchronous work in the workspace-local
`.ultraplan/run-control.db`. `internal/runcontrol` owns operational identity,
lifecycle, owner leases, fencing, cancellation commands, sanitized event
ordering, retention, and terminal arbitration. Sprint, study, smoke, runtime,
lock, artifact, and Git modules remain authoritative for their own product
state; run control only projects their safe correlations and status.

Each start is accepted and claimed in SQLite before a goroutine, runtime child,
or external harness starts. A failed required write fails closed. Direct CLI
commands, TUI actions, web operations, and individual runtime children share
that boundary. IDs are opaque 128-bit `run_*` and `att_*` values. Writers use
short transactions, WAL, `synchronous=FULL`, foreign keys, a five-second busy
timeout, and repository-allocated fencing generations.

Owners tick every second, persist heartbeats every five seconds with a
15-second lease, and reconcile every ten seconds. Reconciliation waits 45
seconds beyond lease expiry and uses exact process-birth identity where the
platform can provide it. An accepted run that never acquired its first claim
is interrupted after the same grace window, with no fabricated attempt or
process evidence. Reconciliation never adopts a worker, signals a PID based on
PID alone, or infers success from artifacts, locks, or product state. One
immutable terminal proposal wins; a cancellation request may therefore coexist
with a later successful completion.

Events are sanitized and committed before delivery. Payloads are allowlisted,
bounded to 16 KiB, and omit prompts, provider-native payloads, credentials,
absolute paths, and unrestricted output. Consumers resume by `(run_id,
sequence)` from SQLite; in-process notifications are only an optimization.
Safe structured repository diagnostics are also written to the private bounded
`.ultraplan/run-control.log` JSONL file. The log is capped at 1 MiB and uses the
same run, attempt, owner/fence, sequence, cancellation, reconciliation, and
terminal correlation vocabulary exposed by diagnostics and support export.

This design supports direct writers and observers on one host and a trustworthy
local filesystem. Multi-host access, network filesystems without reliable
SQLite WAL/locking semantics, worker adoption, brokers, and remote signalling
are outside the supported topology.

## QA evidence and isolation

QA policy belongs to `internal/sprint`; reusable copy, identity, process, and
cleanup mechanics belong to `internal/platform/process`. Each writable check
gets a new `0700` non-Git-dependent copy. On Linux, bubblewrap mounts the host
root read-only and remounts only the disposable copy writable. Platforms that
cannot prove protected-root denial, process-group cleanup, and workspace
removal report the missing capability and QA blocks before writable work.

Frozen plans bind the attempt, shard, expectations, approved paths, exact
executable and argv, time and output limits, cleanup requirement, and governed
fingerprints. QA v2 evidence binds target and copy identities, changed paths,
command facts, containment, and cleanup. Only product adjudication can accept
evidence or promote a bounded issue. Semantic analyzers and failed-shard
evaluators use fixed three-call limits where applicable; a majority is an
adjudication rule, not independent proof.

Immutable plans and evidence are written before adjudication, issues,
assessment, and the canonical pointers. Every publication rechecks the durable
writer fence. `qa.md`, the private state pointer, and the bounded flow
projection are snapshotted and restored together if a later canonical write
fails. QA state v2 is written for evidence attempts; state v1 remains readable
but cannot supply v2 evidence. Canonical smoke execution is reused directly,
not copied into a second runner.
