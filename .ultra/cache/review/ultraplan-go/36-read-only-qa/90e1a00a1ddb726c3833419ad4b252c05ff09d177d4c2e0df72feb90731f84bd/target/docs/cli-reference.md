# CLI Reference

This release includes study commands and governed sprint planning, execute, resumable automated review, integrated `verify`, focused review reruns, review-gated deep smoke, the terminal dashboard, and a loopback-only browser dashboard with guarded operations and SSE progress. Issue management, Git mutation, and hosted services remain deferred.

## Global Usage

```text
ultraplan [--workspace <path>] [command]
```

Global flags:

- `--workspace <path>`: use an explicit workspace path.
- `-h`, `--help`: show help.

Workspace discovery order is explicit flag, `ULTRAPLAN_WORKSPACE`, then current directory ancestry containing `ultraplan.yml`.

## Exit Classes

The CLI uses numeric process statuses:

- `0`: success.
- `1`: internal or write error.
- `2`: usage error.
- `3`: configuration error.
- `4`: workspace or filesystem error.
- `5`: validation/reference error.
- `6`: runtime/provider error.
- `7`: cancellation.
- `8`: partial completion.

Human-readable errors are printed to stderr. JSON commands use documented envelopes or deterministic command-specific JSON described below. Runtime-backed study and sprint commands also stream sanitized progress while preserving final result output. Standalone, run-all, and sprint progress uses stderr so stdout remains machine-readable; the durable study run-loop retains its task-progress stream on stdout. Progress includes lifecycle, provider progress, tool, validation, retry/fallback, permission, warning, and terminal events; message bodies and raw provider payloads are not printed.

## Commands

### `ultraplan init-workspace`

```text
ultraplan init-workspace [--path <dir>] [--dry-run]
```

Creates the minimal required workspace scaffold: `README.md`, `ultraplan.yml`, and `studies/`. The README includes common workspace commands. `--dry-run` prints planned operations without writing files.

Built-in prompts and templates are embedded in the CLI and are not required in the workspace.

### `ultraplan skills materialise`

```text
ultraplan skills materialise [all|stage] [--path <dir>] [--dry-run] [--force]
```

Writes manually invoked sprint-stage skills to
`.agents/skills/ultraplan-<stage>/`. With no selection, all eleven skills are
materialised. Supported stages are `reconcile`, `requirements`, `code-context`, `sprint-index`,
`technical-handbook`, `area-reasoning`, `reasoning`, `plan`, `execute`,
`review`, and `smoke`.

Each generated skill includes `SKILL.md` and `agents/openai.yaml`. Implicit
invocation is disabled. The `SKILL.md` embeds the canonical stage prompt and
adds interactive prerequisite checks, explicit proposal-only behavior,
validation, and flow-state reconciliation.

The manual-only `code-context` skill delegates to the canonical `sprint ... flow --to code-context` operation. It does not reproduce repository selection, prompt construction, artifact validation, atomic replacement, or state transitions.

Behavior matches `defaults install`: missing files are created, identical
files are unchanged, customized files require confirmation, `--force`
overwrites them, and `--dry-run` makes no writes. `materialize` is accepted as
an alias.

### `ultraplan defaults install`

```text
ultraplan defaults install [--path <dir>] [--dry-run] [--force]
```

Writes editable copies of the built-in prompts and templates into a workspace. If `--path` is omitted, the command uses global `--workspace` when present, otherwise the current working directory.

Behavior:

- Missing prompt/template files are created.
- Existing files that exactly match the built-in default are left unchanged.
- Existing files that differ are listed before overwrite.
- Without `--force`, the command asks for confirmation before overwriting customized files.
- A negative or empty answer keeps customized files and creates only non-conflicting missing files.
- `--force` overwrites customized files without asking.
- `--dry-run` prints planned operations and never writes files or asks for confirmation.

### `ultraplan config show`

```text
ultraplan config show [--json]
```

Prints effective configuration after defaults, workspace config, environment overrides, and supported command flags. Sensitive values are redacted.

`--json` uses the stable JSON envelope:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "command": "config show",
  "workspace": "/path/to/workspace",
  "status": "ok",
  "generated_at": "2026-06-13T00:00:00Z",
  "result": {}
}
```

### `ultraplan health`

```text
ultraplan health [--json]
```

Checks workspace discovery, workspace structure, config validation, filesystem readability, environment override presence, and configured runtime health/capability checks when possible.

`--json` uses the stable JSON envelope with `result.schema_version: 1` and a `checks` array.

### `ultraplan project list`

```text
ultraplan project list
```

Lists discovered project roots under `projects/`.

### `ultraplan project <project> status`

```text
ultraplan project <project> status
```

Shows project docs, roadmap, `project-index.md`, sprints, catalog health,
project-owned area reasoning documents, and the effective project/workspace/built-in
source for each reasoning default without runtime execution.

### `ultraplan project <project> validate`

```text
ultraplan project <project> validate
```

Validates required project files and `project-index.md` catalog references for contracts, evidence reports, reasoning templates, review protocols, and the external smoke harness manifest. It also validates project reasoning overrides and rejects reasoning templates owned by a different project.

### `ultraplan study init`

```text
ultraplan study init <study-init.yml> [--dry-run] [--force] [--no-clone] [--output <dir>]
```

Initializes a study from YAML. Clone failures can return partial completion while still reporting created artifacts.

### `ultraplan study list`

```text
ultraplan study list
```

Lists discovered studies under `studies/`.

### `ultraplan study <study> list`

```text
ultraplan study <study> list
```

Lists sources and dimensions for one study. Markdown sources show their applicability filter or `all`. The configured dimension priority from `studies/<study>/study.json` is shown after the natural dimension listing.

### `ultraplan study <study> prompt`

```text
ultraplan study <study> prompt analysis <dimension> <source> [--output <file>]
ultraplan study <study> prompt synthesis <dimension> [--output <file>]
```

Renders a deterministic manifest and prompt text. It does not invoke runtime execution.

Study prompt rendering first checks workspace overrides such as `prompts/base.md` and `templates/report.md`. If no workspace file exists, it uses the built-in default embedded in the CLI.

### `ultraplan study <study> run`

```text
ultraplan study <study> run <dimension> <source>
```

Runs one analysis task through configured agentwrap/OpenCode runtime and validates the expected per-source report.

### `ultraplan study <study> synthesize`

```text
ultraplan study <study> synthesize <dimension>
```

Runs one synthesis task after validating required per-source reports.

### `ultraplan study <study> run-all`

```text
ultraplan study <study> run-all [--dimension <ref>] [--source <ref>] [--parallel <n>]
```

Runs selected applicable analysis tasks, synthesis tasks, and summary generation with bounded parallelism. `--dimension` and `--source` are repeatable. Configured `dimension_order` entries are strict priority tiers: each listed dimension reaches synthesis or another terminal state before the next tier starts, followed by all unlisted dimensions.

### `ultraplan study <study> run-loop`

```text
ultraplan study <study> run-loop [--dimension <ref>] [--source <ref>] [--parallel <n>] [--force-unlock] [--reset] [--yes]
```

Advances shared durable study progress with per-study locking and `studies/<study>/.ultraplan/run-state.json`. By default, existing progress is resumed, reconciled against current source/dimension applicability metadata, and revalidated. `--dimension` and `--source` select the eligible slice to advance; `study.json` priority applies within that slice. Terminal progress shows both selected-scope and whole-study counts. Use `--reset` to archive and rebuild progress, with confirmation unless `--yes` is provided. Use `--force-unlock` only for operator-confirmed stale locks.

### `ultraplan study <study> validate`

```text
ultraplan study <study> validate [--json]
```

Validates study artifacts without runtime execution.

`--json` uses the stable JSON envelope with `command: "study.validate"`. The result contains redacted validation checks and report checks.

### `ultraplan study <study> status`

```text
ultraplan study <study> status [--json]
```

Shows persisted run-state status without runtime execution. Counts are reconciled against the current discovered source/dimension applicability before output, so edited source metadata is reflected without requiring `run-loop --reset`.

`--json` uses the stable JSON envelope with `command: "study.status"` and `result.schema_version: 1`. The stable result includes:

- `run_id`, `complete`, and `state_path`.
- `counts` for pending, running, validating, completed, failed, cancelled, skipped, waiting, retrying, active, and retries.
- optional redacted `lock`.
- `run_metadata` with timestamps, filters, and config summary.
- `tasks` with IDs, kind, status, dimension/source, output path, attempts, retry timing, redacted errors, validation summary, agent status, usage, and cost.
- aggregate `usage` and `cost` where known.

Debug/runtime raw payloads are not a stable public JSON surface.

### `ultraplan study <study> summary`

```text
ultraplan study <study> summary
```

Regenerates deterministic `studies/<study>/summary.csv` from existing reports without runtime execution.

### `ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> status`

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> status [--json]
```

Inspects planning, execute, review, and smoke state and refreshes `projects/<project>/sprints/<sprint>/flow-state.json`. Static smoke readiness validates the catalog, manifest, review gate, artifact, fingerprint, and evidence paths without launching discovery or a run.

### `ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate`

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate requirements
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate code-context
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate sprint-index
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate technical-handbook
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate area-reasoning
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate reasoning
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate plan
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate execute
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate review
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate smoke
```

Validates one planning or execute stage artifact without invoking runtime. `code-context` requires the canonical reference-only Markdown shape with safe repository-relative paths, exact positive line ranges, optional symbols, rationale, and no fenced source. `sprint-index` references must be a subset of `project-index.md`. Plan validation checks traceability to `reasoning.md` and task/evidence checklist structure. Execute validation checks plan task extraction and target safety.

### `ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt`

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt requirements
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt code-context
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt sprint-index
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt technical-handbook
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt area-reasoning
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt reasoning
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt plan
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt execute
```

Prints runtime-free prompt previews for planning and execute stages. Prompt previews are for inspection and do not call agentwrap, OpenCode, providers, subprocesses, or the network. Once a completed valid code-context artifact exists, compatible downstream previews use the same shared composition path as runtime requests: exact stored requirements/context bytes, bounded transient contained source evidence, then the stage boundary and stage-specific suffix.

Planning prompts use the same default/override model as study prompts. The prototype markdown prompt is the instruction source; UltraPlan appends a runtime manifest with concrete project, sprint, path, and selection data.

### `ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow`

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to requirements [--dry-run]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to code-context [--dry-run]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to sprint-index [--dry-run]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to technical-handbook [--dry-run]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to area-reasoning [--dry-run]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to reasoning [--dry-run]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to plan [--dry-run]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to execute [--dry-run]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to review [--restart-review] [--dry-run]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to smoke [--restart-review] [--dry-run] [--yes]
```

Runs or previews the governed stage flow through smoke. Cumulative planning order is `requirements -> code-context -> sprint-index -> technical-handbook -> area-reasoning -> reasoning -> plan`; `flow --to plan` dispatches code-context exactly once when it is not already complete and valid. A code-context rerun reads the configured implementation target with restricted permissions and atomically replaces only `code-context.md`. A non-dry-run flow reports each stage as it is checked, started, skipped, completed, or failed and interleaves sanitized runtime progress. Review and smoke use the same sprint-owned transition as `verify`. Compatible interrupted reviews resume by default; `--restart-review` discards retained review progress. A non-dry-run smoke transition requires `--yes`.

### `ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> execute`

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> execute [--task <id>] [--dry-run] [--resume] [--model <provider/model>]
```

Executes validated top-level `plan.md` task checkboxes through one reusable generic-runtime agent session. The first turn receives the shared sprint context, ordered queue, and current task; each later task is a compact continuation in that session. UltraPlan checkpoints each task before advancing, stops the queue on failure/cancellation, writes `.run-state.json` and `execute.md`, requires runtime evidence or a safe diagnostic before marking a task complete, and constrains work to the project index target implementation directory. If the runtime supplies no reusable session ID, execution safely falls back to complete independent prompts.

Explicitly defer accepted follow-up work with a required rationale:

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> execute --task <id> --defer --reason "accepted rationale and follow-up owner"
```

Deferral is a durable terminal outcome shown in `execute.md` and status counts. The plan checkbox remains unchecked so deferred work is not represented as implemented. Review accepts it only when the unchecked task's stable ID has a matching governed `deferred` outcome; arbitrary unchecked or manually checked tasks cannot bypass execution.

The normal agent-owned path uses the plan itself. During an active execute attempt, the execute agent may replace the task's top-level `[ ]` marker with `[/]` and append an inline rationale:

```markdown
- [/] **Task 6: Persist shutdown uncertainty** — Deferred: requires a separately governed owner capability in Sprint 32
```

After the runtime returns, UltraPlan validates the reason, preserves the task's stable ID, records the durable `deferred` outcome, and continues with the next task. A `[/]` marker without `— Deferred: <reason>` is invalid. A pre-existing marker cannot bypass a new execution or review unless the matching run-state already records that deferral.

### `ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> review`

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> review [--focus <coverage-id>] [--restart] [--dry-run] [--model <provider/model>] [--parallel <n>] [--json]
```

Runs bounded read-only Conformance Review workers and atomically writes `review.md`. `conformance-review` is an exact alias for this handler; the command name, `review.md`, verdicts, JSON operation name, and exits remain compatible. Compatible interrupted attempts resume validated coverage and retained OpenCode sessions. Use `--restart` to discard the resumable attempt and start fresh. A focused rerun promotes only when all other coverage can be retained from the same current fingerprint.

Example:

```bash
ultraplan sprint ultraplan-go 28-review-to-smoke-flow review --focus architecture --json
```

### `ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> qa`

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> qa --dry-run [--json]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> qa [--shard <map-owned-id>] [--json]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> qa resume [--shard <map-owned-id>] [--json]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> qa status [--json]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> qa cancel --run <durable-run-id> [--json]
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> qa recover [--json]
```

`--dry-run` creates the byte-stable current map without a runtime, durable acceptance, or state write. Start and resume require current execute and Conformance Review evidence, accept and claim a durable run before child work, and optionally focus one current map-owned shard. Commands, paths, permissions, fingerprints, IDs, prompts, and theory content are product-owned. There are no caller flags for model or budgets. Workspace configuration may select the model and lower product limits.

`status` is read-only. `cancel` sends an explicit request through durable run control; closing a terminal or browser session does not cancel work. `recover` is runtime-free but may reconcile an interrupted/stale pointer, digest, bounded flow summary, or retention state. Resume always creates a new durable owner and never adopts an old runtime session.

Text says `Read-only QA completed` when bounded work ends. This is not a pass verdict. Theory outcomes are `confirmed`, `refuted`, `invalid`, `inconclusive`, `blocked`, `cross_shard`, and `not_applicable`; none is automatically an issue. QA cannot change the separate Conformance Review verdict.

With `--json`, success or failure is one object with `schema_version: 1`, `operation: "sprint.qa"`, `status`, `result`, and an optional stable `error`. The result carries phase and freshness separately from run lifecycle, cancellation, terminal result, Conformance Review status/verdict/freshness, fingerprints, coverage, effective limits, bounded shards, outcome totals, blocker, and next action. Usage errors use exit 2, configuration errors 3, validation/stale/policy errors 5, runtime or persistence failures 6, and cancellation or deadline partial results 8.

QA configuration uses normal precedence: product default, `ultraplan.yml`, then environment. Invalid workspace or environment values stop configuration loading. Integer limits and durations must be positive and cannot exceed the listed hard maximum. A default equal to its maximum can still be lowered.

| `qa` key | Environment | Default | Hard maximum |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `model` | `ULTRAPLAN_QA_MODEL` | review, plan, then default-model fallback | not numeric |
| `variant` | `ULTRAPLAN_QA_VARIANT` | `execution.default_variant` | not numeric |

| `state_bytes` | `ULTRAPLAN_QA_STATE_BYTES` | 134217728 | 134217728 |

`qa.model` falls back to `planning.review_model`, then `planning.plan_model`, then `models.default`. `qa.variant` falls back to `execution.default_variant`. Model changes can alter cost, latency, and investigator behavior. They change the policy fingerprint, make retained QA state stale, and require a fresh dry-run before another start. Restore the prior model value to roll back, then rebuild the map so the recorded policy matches the actual request.

### `ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> smoke`

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> smoke [--level <id>|--suite <id>|--test <id>] [--timeout <duration>] [--force-review --override-reason <text>] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--json]
```

Gates on the current review fingerprint, then uses `planning.smoke_model` to create or update a durable sprint-specific suite in the cataloged protocol-v1 harness. Authoring is restricted to manifest-declared paths and targets non-deterministic real boundaries not already settled by normal tests. UltraPlan then discovers enumerated coverage/tests, selects sufficient scope, invokes direct bounded argv, verifies the exact executed test identities and external evidence, and atomically writes `smoke.md` before smoke flow state. `--force-review` additionally requires `--override-reason`; the resulting run is diagnostic and cannot promote the review or overall assessment. Raw streams and run/issue evidence remain external. Timeout, cancellation, missing coverage, out-of-scope author changes, malformed evidence, path escape, and uncertain cleanup never replace a valid summary.

Example:

```bash
ultraplan sprint ultraplan-go 28-review-to-smoke-flow smoke --dry-run --json
```

### `ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> verify`

```text
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> verify [--to review|smoke] [--focus-review <coverage-id>] [--restart-review] [--level <id>|--suite <id>|--test <id>] [--timeout <duration>] [--force-review --override-reason <text>] [--dry-run] [--yes] [--json]
```

Runs the shared execute-evidence → review → smoke transition. It requires complete execute evidence, reuses a current review or resumes compatible unfinished review coverage, and applies the review gate before smoke. `--restart-review` starts all reviewers in fresh sessions. Focused review and narrow smoke selections remain diagnostic unless complete retained or containing coverage proves they can promote canonical evidence.

Example:

```bash
ultraplan sprint ultraplan-go 28-review-to-smoke-flow verify --to smoke --yes
```

### `ultraplan code`

```text
ultraplan code <report>... [--json] [--output <path>]
```

Extracts cited code snippets from one or more reports. Text output is human-oriented. `--json` renders deterministic code extraction JSON with reports, sources, references, diagnostics, unresolved entries, and status.

### `ultraplan serve`

```text
ultraplan [--workspace <path>] serve [--listen <address>] [--open-browser]
```

Starts the guarded local browser dashboard. Workspace selection uses the
normal precedence: global `--workspace`, `ULTRAPLAN_WORKSPACE`, then current
directory ancestry. Configuration is loaded and validated before a listener is
opened.

- `--listen` defaults to `127.0.0.1:8080`. It must contain a numeric loopback
  IP and an explicit port. Canonical examples are `127.0.0.1:8080` and
  `[::1]:8080`; `localhost`, port zero, wildcard, LAN, and public addresses are
  rejected before server startup.
- `--open-browser` asks the platform browser launcher to open the canonical
  bound URL after listening succeeds. A launcher failure is a redacted warning;
  the healthy server continues and the printed URL can be opened manually.
- Startup/listen failures use the existing error exit class. Interrupt or
  process-context cancellation first drains new commands, cancels every active
  server-owned operation through its canonical app context, waits for bounded
  durable reconciliation, then shuts down HTTP. Cleanup uncertainty is not
  reported as success.

`serve --help` never opens a listener or parses the embedded templates.
Existing CLI commands, `ultraplan tui`, and the browser remain independent
adapters over the same typed app operation services. Browser commands use a
two-step current confirmation, bounded ephemeral status/SSE, and explicit
`DELETE` cancellation. They do not change CLI flags or automation semantics;
the browser cannot edit arbitrary files, submit arbitrary commands, or mutate
Git. See
[Local Web Dashboard](local-web.md) for routes, limits, trust boundaries, and
troubleshooting.

### `ultraplan version`

Prints version, commit, build date, and Go version metadata.

## Stable JSON Surfaces

The compatibility-sensitive JSON surfaces in this release are:

- `config show --json`
- `health --json`
- `study <study> validate --json`
- `study <study> status --json`
- `code --json` deterministic extraction result
- `sprint <project> <sprint> status --json`
- `sprint <project> <sprint> review --json`
- `sprint <project> <sprint> qa --json`
- `sprint <project> <sprint> smoke --json`
- `sprint <project> <sprint> verify --json`

The Phase 3 field-level compatibility contract is documented in [Phase 3 JSON Schemas](phase3-json-schemas.md).

Sprint `status --json`, `review --json`, `qa --json`, and `smoke --json` also expose schema-versioned envelopes. Other text output is intended for humans unless explicitly promoted to stable JSON.
## Durable run commands

All commands operate on the selected workspace (`--workspace` or normal
discovery) and do not contact a provider.

```text
ultraplan run list [--project <ref>] [--sprint <ref>] [--study <ref>]
                   [--lifecycle <comma-list>] [--limit <1..200>]
                   [--after <cursor>] [--json]
ultraplan run show <run-id> [--json]
ultraplan run follow <run-id> [--after <sequence>] [--json]
ultraplan run cancel <run-id> [--reason user_requested] [--json]
ultraplan run diagnostics [--json] [--support-export <file>]
```

`list` is newest-first, defaults to 50 records, and returns an opaque pagination
cursor. Active means only `accepted`, `queued`, `running`, or `cancelling`.
`follow` replays committed events, polls quickly while catching up and at most
once per second while idle. Interrupting follow stops observation only; use
`cancel` for an explicit durable cancellation command. Cancellation is
idempotent and does not overwrite an already-terminal winner.

Diagnostics reports schema/WAL, quota, retention, active/stalled ownership, and
reconciliation backlog. `--support-export` creates a private, bounded file (at
most 1 MiB) containing safe snapshots, event headers/omission facts, health,
config source classes, reconciliation decisions, and the newest sanitized
records from `.ultraplan/run-control.log`; it excludes event payloads, prompts,
provider data, source content, credentials, arbitrary output, and the absolute
workspace path.
