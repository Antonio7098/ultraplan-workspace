# Gated Planning And Deep Smoke

The normal release gates are offline and do not require OpenCode, provider credentials, network access, or real subprocess smoke fixtures. This smoke is optional and gated for machines that have a real runtime environment and a prepared planning project.

## Prerequisites

- Built `ultraplan` binary or `go run ./cmd/ultraplan`.
- Initialized UltraPlan workspace with `projects/`.
- Valid `ultraplan.yml`.
- A project containing `docs/`, `roadmap.md`, and `project-index.md`.
- A sprint containing at least `requirements.md`.
- A readable `Target Implementation Directory`, absolute or relative to the UltraPlan workspace root, and source references contained by it.
- OpenCode executable available through `agentwrap.executable` if running non-dry-run flow.
- Provider/model configured through OpenCode/provider-native mechanisms if running non-dry-run flow.
- Required network access for the provider if running non-dry-run flow.
- No provider tokens or sensitive environment values captured in logs or evidence.

## Offline Planning Checks

These checks do not invoke runtime execution:

```bash
ultraplan skills materialise all --dry-run
ultraplan project <project> status
ultraplan project <project> validate
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> status
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt code-context
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate code-context
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt sprint-index
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt technical-handbook
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt area-reasoning
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt reasoning
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> prompt plan
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to plan --dry-run
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to execute --dry-run
```

In a disposable workspace, also materialise all skills and confirm that each
`.agents/skills/ultraplan-<stage>/SKILL.md` has matching
`agents/openai.yaml` metadata with implicit invocation disabled.

## Runtime Planning Smoke

Run only when the runtime prerequisites are available:

```bash
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to requirements
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate requirements
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to code-context
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate code-context
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to sprint-index
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate sprint-index
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to technical-handbook
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate technical-handbook
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to reasoning
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate reasoning
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to plan
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate plan
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate execute
```

Use `area-reasoning` only when the selected sprint-index includes reasoning templates that require area artifacts.

### Disposable requirements-to-plan dogfood

Run the grounded-planning dogfood only in a newly created disposable workspace. Copy or author the minimum project catalog/docs/roadmap and requirements there, point `Target Implementation Directory` at the real read-only implementation repository using an absolute path or one relative to the disposable workspace root, and keep the production planning workspace, product source/tests, smoke harness, and Git metadata outside every writable runtime path. Record before/after `git status --short` and content identities for those protected locations.

```bash
go run ./cmd/ultraplan --workspace "$DOGFOOD_WORKSPACE" \
  sprint "$DOGFOOD_PROJECT" "$DOGFOOD_SPRINT" flow --to plan
```

A pass requires observed evidence that at least one real runtime request was sent, `code-context.md` is valid and reference-only, `plan.md` is valid, the call log is `requirements -> code-context -> sprint-index -> technical-handbook -> area-reasoning -> reasoning -> plan` with code-context exactly once, captured downstream prompts have one identical prefix through the stage boundary, and protected locations did not change. Record the runtime executable, provider/model, command, prompt/call evidence, artifact validation, and mutation comparison.

If the executable, credential, provider/model, network, permissions, or required runtime capability is unavailable, record `blocked` and name that exact prerequisite. A fake runtime, constructed but unsent prompt, permission-denied request, or artifact-only observation is not a real-runtime pass. The renderer's stable layout does not guarantee, measure, own, or depend on provider cache hits.

## Review-Gated Deep Smoke

The project catalog must contain one `Smoke Harnesses` row with an absolute harness root and a manifest contained by that root. The manifest is strict protocol v1 and supplies direct executable/argv forms, discovery/run commands, bounded authoring paths, evidence roots, capabilities, and environment names. Configure `planning.smoke_model` and `planning.smoke_variant` for the authoring agent.

```bash
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> review
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> smoke --dry-run
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> smoke --yes
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate smoke
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> status --json
```

A current `pass` or `pass_with_findings` review runs normally. A current `fail` or `blocked` review requires an explicitly confirmed `--force-review` diagnostic run; missing, malformed, or stale review evidence cannot be overridden. Use only one of `--level`, `--suite`, or `--test`.

Every non-dry run has an author phase before discovery. The smoke model reads the governed sprint evidence, target implementation and deterministic tests, then creates or updates a durable sprint suite inside the manifest-declared authoring paths. It must target real boundaries that ordinary unit/integration tests cannot settle—real provider/model calls where the product path uses them, OS processes/signals, filesystems, network listeners, browser engines, credentials, cancellation, timing and platform behavior. Discovery must enumerate required coverage IDs, non-empty suite test IDs and per-test coverage ownership. Empty or self-declared coverage is blocked. A narrow diagnostic test does not replace required containing-suite evidence.

Cancellation terminates the owned process group, waits for cleanup, and escalates within the configured grace period. Timeout, cancellation, malformed output, missing evidence, path escape, hash mismatch, or uncertain cleanup never creates a passing summary and does not replace the last valid `smoke.md`.

Durable sprint suites remain in the manifest-declared harness authoring paths. Raw JSON, stdout/stderr, per-test artifacts, and issues remain in the manifest-declared harness `runs/` and `issues/` roots. The sprint owns only `smoke.md` and smoke flow state; the summary records the author run/model, changed harness paths and exact executed test IDs.

The real harness lane is explicit:

```bash
ULTRAPLAN_REAL_SMOKE=1 go test ./internal/sprint -run TestRealSmokeHarness -v
```

Without the gate, harness, current review, runtime, credentials, or network, record the exact skipped/blocked prerequisite; never report a pass.

## Expected Artifacts

- `projects/<project>/sprints/<sprint>/sprint-index.md`
- `projects/<project>/sprints/<sprint>/code-context.md`
- `projects/<project>/sprints/<sprint>/technical-handbook.md`
- optional files under `projects/<project>/sprints/<sprint>/reasoning/`
- `projects/<project>/sprints/<sprint>/reasoning.md`
- `projects/<project>/sprints/<sprint>/plan.md`
- `projects/<project>/sprints/<sprint>/flow-state.json`

Deep smoke may write only the current sprint `smoke.md`, smoke flow state, manifest-declared harness authoring paths, and manifest-declared external run/issue evidence. It never mutates product source/tests, governed planning inputs, other harness paths, or Git state.

## Skip Path

If prerequisites are unavailable, record a skip in release evidence:

```text
Gated planning runtime smoke: skipped
Reason: missing <OpenCode executable | provider credentials | network | configured workspace | prepared planning project>
Risk: real runtime planning generation was not exercised on this machine; offline tests, build gates, prompt previews, and dry-run checks still passed.
```

Do not dump full environment variables, provider tokens, full prompts, generated artifact bodies, or raw runtime payloads.
