# UltraPlan Go

UltraPlan Go is a local-first CLI for durable architecture studies and governed sprint delivery. It initializes study workspaces, runs source and dimension analyses through agentwrap/OpenCode, synthesizes reports, validates artifacts, executes sprint plans, runs resumable automated reviews, drives review-gated smoke verification, and embeds manually invoked skills for every sprint stage.

This release includes study workflows and the grounded governed sprint chain `requirements -> code-context -> sprint-index -> technical-handbook -> area-reasoning -> reasoning -> plan -> execute -> review -> smoke -> merge`, including integrated `sprint verify`, durable review resume, focused review reruns, explicit diagnostic smoke overrides, and a governed final merge into the branch recorded when UltraPlan creates the sprint worktree. The merge command computes Git inputs, locking, staging, validation, commit creation, and recovery itself. An agent writes the description and edits only conflicted paths. `code-context.md` stores repository-relative references only; later agent-backed stages receive one byte-stable shared prefix containing the exact requirements and context-pack bytes plus bounded transient live source evidence. Agents may still inspect additional repository files. Issue management, hosted SaaS, multi-user collaboration, arbitrary Git automation, retrieval/indexing, UltraPlan cache ownership, signing, notarization, tags, and artifact upload remain deferred.

Phase 3 operators should start with the [CLI reference](docs/cli-reference.md), [recovery runbook](docs/recovery.md), [JSON schema contract](docs/phase3-json-schemas.md), and [legacy verification migration guide](docs/phase3-migration.md). The authoritative product requirements, technical requirements, architecture, roadmap, and sprint plans live in the adjacent `ultraplan-go-workspace/projects/ultraplan-go/` planning workspace; this repository does not duplicate them.

## Install

Install to your user bin directory, which keeps the `ultraplan` command in the same place for future upgrades:

```bash
./scripts/install-ultraplan.sh
```

That script installs `ultraplan` from the current checkout to `~/.local/bin` by default. It can be run from any directory. If you prefer a different bin directory, set `GOBIN` first:

```bash
GOBIN="$HOME/bin" ./scripts/install-ultraplan.sh
```

Build from source:

```bash
go build -o bin/ultraplan ./cmd/ultraplan
```

Run the built binary:

```bash
./bin/ultraplan --help
```

For local release artifacts, see [docs/release-checklist.md](docs/release-checklist.md). This repository packages Linux and macOS binaries under `dist/` when the release checklist is run.

## Quick Start

Initialize a workspace:

```bash
ultraplan init-workspace --path .
```

Check workspace, config, and runtime health:

```bash
ultraplan health
```

Inspect effective configuration:

```bash
ultraplan config show
ultraplan config show --json
```

Initialize a study from YAML:

```bash
ultraplan study init study-init.yml --no-clone
```

List studies, sources, and dimensions:

```bash
ultraplan study list
ultraplan study <study> list
```

Preview prompts without runtime execution:

```bash
ultraplan study <study> prompt analysis 01 <source>
ultraplan study <study> prompt synthesis 01 --output previews/synthesis-01.txt
```

Install editable copies of the built-in prompts and templates only when you want to customize them:

```bash
ultraplan defaults install --dry-run
ultraplan defaults install
```

Materialise all manually invoked stage skills, or just one:

```bash
ultraplan skills materialise
ultraplan skills materialise reasoning
ultraplan skills materialise code-context
```

Run study work:

```bash
ultraplan study <study> run 01 <source>
ultraplan study <study> synthesize 01
ultraplan study <study> run-all --parallel 3
ultraplan study <study> run-loop --parallel 3
ultraplan study <study> run-loop --dimension 01 --source <source> --parallel 1
```

`run-loop` resumes shared study progress by default. Dimension/source filters advance only that slice of the study graph while progress is still stored in `studies/<study>/.ultraplan/run-state.json`. Use `--reset` only when you intentionally want to archive and rebuild study progress.

Validate, inspect status, summarize, and extract code references:

```bash
ultraplan study <study> validate --json
ultraplan study <study> status
ultraplan study <study> summary
ultraplan code studies/<study>/reports/final/01-topic.md --json
```

Inspect planning projects and validate governed sprint artifacts:

```bash
ultraplan project list
ultraplan project <project> status
ultraplan project <project> validate
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> status
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate requirements
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate sprint-index
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> validate execute
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to requirements --dry-run
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to plan --dry-run
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to execute --dry-run
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> execute --resume
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> merge --dry-run
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> merge --yes
ultraplan sprint <project> <sprint> flow --to merge --yes --cleanup-worktree
```

## Workspace Model

`init-workspace` creates the minimal required workspace:

```text
README.md
ultraplan.yml
studies/
```

Prompts and templates are built into the CLI. A workspace does not need `prompts/` or `templates/` to run. If a workspace file exists at the same relative path, it overrides the built-in default. Use `ultraplan defaults install` to materialize editable copies:

```text
prompts/
  base.md
  synthesize.md
  create-sprint-index.md
  create-technical-handbook.md
  create-area-reasoning.md
  create-sprint-reasoning.md
  plan-sprint.md
  ...
templates/
  repo-analysis.md
  report.md
  sprint-index.md
  technical-handbook.md
  sprint-reasoning.md
  sprint-plan.md
  ...
```

If an existing workspace prompt or template differs from the built-in default, `defaults install` lists the customized file and asks before overwriting it. Use `--force` only when you intentionally want to replace customized files without confirmation.

Reasoning defaults may also be specialised per project. UltraPlan resolves
`create-area-reasoning.md`, `create-sprint-reasoning.md`, and
`sprint-reasoning.md` in this order: project override, workspace override,
then built-in default. Project overrides live at:

```text
projects/<project>/prompts/create-area-reasoning.md
projects/<project>/prompts/create-sprint-reasoning.md
projects/<project>/templates/sprint-reasoning.md
```

Studies live under `studies/<study>/` with editable source, dimension, report, run-state, and summary artifacts. Directory sources are analyzed by path. Live directory-source metadata is stored in `sources/<source>.ultraplan-source.yml` or `sources/<source>/.ultraplan-source.yml`; `applicable_dimensions` there limits which dimensions apply. Top-level Markdown sources can declare the same filter in frontmatter. `study-init.yml` is retained as initialization provenance, not the live applicability contract.

Each initialized study also has an editable `studies/<study>/study.json`. Its optional `dimension_order` list runs the referenced dimensions first, in order, before the remaining dimensions. Each listed dimension completes its applicable analyses and synthesis before the next tier starts; unlisted dimensions retain natural ordering and bounded parallelism. Existing studies without `study.json` retain their current behavior.

Study reports are dimension-scoped. Per-source reports are written to `studies/<study>/reports/source/<dimension-ref>/<source>.md`, and synthesis writes `studies/<study>/reports/final/<dimension-ref>.md`.

Projects live under `projects/<project>/` with `docs/`, `roadmap.md`, `project-index.md`, and `sprints/<sprint>/`. A project can keep specialised area reasoning documents under `projects/<project>/reasoning/` and list them in `project-index.md`. Planning sprints are editable Markdown/JSON artifact chains through `requirements.md`, reference-only `code-context.md`, `sprint-index.md`, `technical-handbook.md`, optional `reasoning/*.md`, `reasoning.md`, `plan.md`, and `flow-state.json`. `flow --to plan` runs code-context exactly once after requirements.

Manually invoked stage skills are materialised under `.agents/skills/`. Each
skill contains the corresponding canonical prompt plus interactive
prerequisite, proposal, validation, and reconciliation rules. They are marked
manual-only and therefore require explicit `$ultraplan-<stage>` invocation.
`$ultraplan-code-context` is the narrow canonical-delegation exception: it invokes `ultraplan sprint "$PROJECT" "$SPRINT" flow --to code-context`, leaving target resolution, read-only runtime policy, validation, atomic promotion, and state transitions in the product operation.

## Runtime Boundary

UltraPlan owns study behavior and artifact validation. Runtime execution is delegated through `github.com/Antonio7098/agentwrap` and its OpenCode adapter. UltraPlan does not claim direct OpenCode process supervision, provider billing ownership, or provider-agnostic guarantees that bypass the configured runtime.

Default tests are offline and fake-first. Real OpenCode smoke is gated by local OpenCode, provider configuration, network availability, and a prepared workspace.

## Development

Run the offline test suite:

```bash
go test ./...
```

Run the race suite:

```bash
go test -race ./...
```

Build the CLI:

```bash
go build ./cmd/ultraplan
```

The architecture keeps product behavior inside product modules:

- `internal/workspace` owns workspace discovery, path safety, workspace validation, and embedded stage-skill materialisation.
- `internal/study` owns study workflows, prompts, validation, execution, summaries, and durable state.
- `internal/project` owns project discovery, project-index catalog validation, and project status.
- `internal/sprint` owns planning artifacts, flow state, stage validation, prompt previews, and flow execution through `plan.md`.
- `internal/codeextract` owns citation parsing and snippet extraction.
- `internal/platform/*` owns cross-cutting infrastructure and generic runtime integration.
- `internal/app` owns CLI wiring and process exit behavior.
