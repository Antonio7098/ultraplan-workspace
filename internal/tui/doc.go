// Package tui owns UltraPlan's local terminal dashboard.
//
// The package is dependency-contained and delegates operational work through
// typed application use cases. It
// uses Bubble Tea for the terminal event loop and keeps its model/update/render
// state testable without a real terminal. Terminal program setup, terminal
// library types, navigation, key handling, preview state, rendering, and
// UI-local error panes belong here and must not leak into internal/app or
// product packages.
//
// The dashboard supports every sprint status, validation, prompt, flow, execute,
// review, and smoke operation, plus resumable study run-loop operations. Prompt previews
// and dry runs are bounded, and runtime-backed or mutating actions are confirmed.
// Runtime operations are single-owner and cancellable; product services retain
// durable-state ownership. The package does not call CLI handlers, parse their
// output, invoke ultraplan as a subprocess, mutate Git, launch plugins, create
// alternate smoke/issue artifacts, or persist TUI-specific state.
